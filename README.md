**Daphne** is a framework that includes everything necessary to create database-powered web applications. It's a *full-stack* framework based on MySQL, PHP, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

Daphne implements the *Active Record Pattern* to map PHP classes to database tables: A class represents a table where the members of that class represent table columns. A class instance (object) is tied to a single row in a table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the related table upon save.
